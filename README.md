# City-Hospital-Data-Analysis — City Hospital

Author: Umar Ruhiya
Date: 2025-11-18

##Project Background

City Hospital has been facing serious operational challenges including emergency room (ER) overload, uneven staff distribution, prolonged patient stay durations, inefficient medication usage, insurance billing gaps, and high rates of inconclusive lab test results.

This project uses the hospital’s patient dataset to perform a full Excel-based analysis and produce an interactive operational dashboard with actionable insights for hospital leadership.

##Project Objective

Identify key drivers behind ER congestion and extended patient stays

Analyze patient demographics, doctor workload distribution, medication usage, and lab test outcomes

Examine billing patterns across insurance providers to detect revenue leakage

Build an interactive Excel dashboard to support hospital management decisions

Provide prioritized recommendations to improve efficiency and resource allocation

##Datasets:

City Hospital Dataset.xlsx
Contains:
Patient ID, Age, Gender, Blood Type, Medical Condition, Admission Type, Date of Admission, Discharge Date, Doctor, Insurance Provider, Medication, Test Results, Billing Amount, Room Number, GPS Coordinates

##Dashboard Features

Key KPIs:

Total Patients

Total Billing Amount

Average Length of Stay

Emergency Admission Percentage

Average Patients per Doctor

Visuals:

Patient Age Distribution

Admission Type Breakdown

Doctor Workload Chart

Medical Condition Frequency

Revenue by Insurance Provider

Medication Usage Distribution

Test Result Outcomes

Interactivity:

Slicers for Gender, Age Group, Doctor, Admission Type, Medical Condition, Insurance Provider

##Key Findings

High proportion of Emergency admissions, especially among adults and elderly patients → contributes to ER pressure

Doctor workload imbalance observed, indicating some doctors manage significantly more patients than others

Medication demand imbalance suggests poor stock planning: some drugs are overused while others show minimal usage

Significant number of inconclusive test results, indicating possible lab process inefficiencies

Insurance revenue distribution is uneven, with certain providers contributing more to hospital revenue

Average Length of Stay is 16 days, suggesting delays in diagnostics, discharge processes, or treatment cycles

##Recommendations

Strengthen triage protocols and emergency resource allocation

Rebalance doctor workload through optimized scheduling and shift planning

Implement inventory monitoring to improve medication availability and reduce waste

Upgrade lab testing procedures to reduce inconclusive results (target <5%)

Review and streamline the insurance claims process to minimize revenue loss

Introduce weekly KPI monitoring and monthly operational reviews for leadership
